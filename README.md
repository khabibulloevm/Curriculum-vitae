### What can you expect in this repository?

This is an addition to Khabibulloev Mukhammadsodik's  curriculum vitae. <br>
This repository contains parts of my code that I wrote as a student and decided to show you.

I can't show you all the projects I've done because some of them are lost and some of them are protected by privacy documents and  it's difficult to get permission to show them
